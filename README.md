# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize and understand various searching and pathfinding algorithms. It includes algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and more.

## Features

- Visualize how algorithms work step by step.
- Support for searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search) and pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS).
- Customizable settings to adjust the speed and input parameters.
- User-friendly interface with interactive visualizations.
